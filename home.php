    <p id="textanim">Simplicity demonstrates happiness with less.
    Iâ€™ve learned that more attracts more and less attracts less when it comes to stuff and clutter and
    things you think you must have. If you ask most people what they really want from life and work their
    first answer is not more money, a bigger house, or a new car. Instead they want health, happiness, time,
    security, love, respect, satisfaction, inspiration, and less stress. None of those things are available
    at the mall or through any material purchase.

    Ironically, there are many more simple truths about living with less. Your journey can be inspired by other 
    people sharing stories of simplicity, but ultimately you will find a version of simplicity that best fits your life.</p>
